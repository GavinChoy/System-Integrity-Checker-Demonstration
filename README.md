# System-Integrity-Checker-Demonstration

This is a proof of concept demonstration for a research project conducted at the University of Westminster.

NOTE: The code could have been made better, but this was only intended as a proof of concept demonstration.

This Python program demonstrates how a system can verify its integrity as well as the integrity of any files that are sent to it. The system will also calculate and send checksums of any files that it will be sending.

This only works on Windows platforms due to having operating system dependent code.

For more details about this program, please see the folder named *Documentation*.
